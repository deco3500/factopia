## Introduction

## Concept
### Issue
  
  Nowadays people are constantly bombarded with a lot of news. 
  Consider the following scenario: You are surfing your favorite social network platform all jolly and such, behaving like how a standup citizen would, then someone decided to post something along the line of "Gummy bear does not contain real bear, *Gasps*". Being a long time supporter of the product, you went out of your way to verify the fact, meaning a lot of surfing the web with the promise of walls of text, not knowing if it just someone doing it for the fun and giggles...
  How many times have that already happen to you? 
  Are you tired of walls of text?
  I know that I am.
  
### Solution
  
  Well, how about a place where you can verify absolutely anything and everything that is regardeds as news by anyone?
  We not only help circulate the news and facts, but also give the user a wonderfull experience while they trying to obtain it.
  A social network, which is catered to feel like an space journey that contain lot of visualizations and effects. A universe, where you can go on a space experdition to seek the truth and having the power to create your own giant flying rocks whose entire existence and prosperity are depend on its ability to provide useful information to other fine space astronaunts such as yourself. 
  
  That is Factopia
