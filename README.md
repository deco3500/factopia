## Introduction ##
**factopia** is a visual social news network, that facilitates the distribution of verified news and information

## Concept ##

** Version 1 **

### Issue
  
  Nowadays people are constantly bombarded with a lot of news. 
  Consider the following scenario: you are surfing your favorite social network platform, someone decide to post something like "Chris Brown just got arrested for DUI, *sad face*", you (being a hardcore fan of the singer) feel like your world are falling apart (for some reason). 
  But then its turn out it just someone try to be funny and doing it for the intention. How many times has that already happen to you?
  
### Solution
  Well, how about a place where you can verify anything and everything that is regardeds as news by anyone?
  We provide not just the confirmation of news, but give the user a wonderfull experience while they at it.
  A social network, that inform people of news and mask it as an space journey that contain lot of visualization and not a dull momment. Where everything is space-related, where news are planets that are created by a user and thrive solely on other decisions.
  
  That is Factopia
