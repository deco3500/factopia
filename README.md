# *Evolution of concept through Iterations*

***Initial Idea:***
  - Aim to create a medium that encourage facts to be distributed and verified.

***1st Major Iteration:***
  - Create a message board that provide user with facts that are verified and also allow them to post their own facts to be verified.
  - Facts are mostly generated and/or verified by certified paid experts. 
  
***2nd Major Iteration:***
  - Removing the need to employ paid experts by integate a point system where the points are given to active user with high credibility judging from his past activity. 
  - Adding integrity aspect into the application.
  - Facts or news will be facilitate by users rather than chosen experts.
  - Heading to develop an user driven news distribution medium.

***3rd Major Iteration:***
  - Finalizing on ideas and concepts
  - Focus on the the visual aspect, aim create an unique experience that has never been done before.
  - Bringing space travel as the main underline theme.
  
***4th Major Iteration(Final):***
  - Lock down on design concept.
  - Include more social aspect with co-operative work as main focus.
  - Conclude functions and transition.
  - Pushing out code-based interactive prototype & mockup interactive prototype. 

## Introduction
**Factopia** is a visual social news network, that facilitates the distribution and verification news and information in the form of space expedition. It is a community based, community-driven social network.

## Concept

### Issue
  
  Nowadays people are constantly bombarded with a lot of news. With that abundance of information comes many new, unprecedented issues that are still unable to be resolved by the current social media networks.
  
  Consider the following scenario: You are leisurely surfing your favorite social network platform, when suddenly you come across a headline: “Scientists have just discovered a new way of weight loss using a diet based on cucumbers”. Being a cautious reader, you would immediately question such an article, and so would like to verify it. However, now you are faced with a different dilemma: “do I really want to look through walls of text to find the answer? Even if I post up a question in a forum, I may not get an answer immediately, and even if I do, how do I know if that answer is trustworthy?”. That is one of the many issues with news nowadays.
  
  Consider another scenario, instead of that shady headline, what if you come across something like: “Johnny Depp is eating in restaurant X!”. Being a big fan of Pirates of the Caribbean, you would like to find out more about what your favourite actor is. The question is: where can I find more information about such events? If Twitter, which hashtag should I use? If I wait until the newspaper articles come out, it is already too late, and even Facebook might not update fast enough. How can I get up-to-date with what Johnny Depp is doing?
  
  Factopia is an application that directly addresses those issues.
  
### Design Solution

  Factopia is designed to allow people who are more credible will have greater weight in their voice. What that means is that when a post is uploaded, people can either vote it up or down. However, each person’s vote has different weight. Someone with higher credibility rating will have a greater weight in their vote than someone with lower credibility rating. The overall impact is that, even if there are many people (who do not have high credibility) up-voting a certain post, when someone with a high credibility comes along and down-votes it, the post’s credibility point will go down significantly. If someone has a lot of highly verified post, his credibility rating will go up. This will make sure that well-verified news are more abundant in the network of news provided by Factopia.
  
  In order to make the application more attractive, the theme of the app will be a space-exploration theme. In the universe of Factopia, each post is a planet, and anyone can visit different planets and talk to different peoples who are either currently on that planet, or have set up subscription to a certain planet. To create a related post, users can ‘spawn’ a new planet near the planet that they see, and so that newly spawned post will be group together with the original post. Related planets (posts) will be automatically grouped to form a universe, and users can traverse between universes using a variety of filters and search terms, such as “Local News”, “Hottest News”, “Celebrity Updates”. With this grouping system, it will ensure that users can get updates on a certain topic (represented by a ‘universe’ - a group of planets) very quickly by traversing and exploring planets in that universe.
  
  Each person will also have a ‘home base’, which is based on their actual GPS location. When they relocate back to their home base, they can browse the most local news around them.

### Audience
  Since the app focus on visualizing the distribution of information and news, naturally space enthusiasts and teenager and people who are exposed to the many existing social network and desiring something with more than just blocks of text when they enquire for information will be its main target audience. However, as the project grows, we may redesign the user interface to accommodate a greater audience pool.
  
### How it differs from existing technologies
  It should be clear by now that Factopia is not just a social network. It is a social network that focuses on making sure people can get updates from the most current news easily, but still ensure the quality of those news by providing a very rigorous community-driven verification system. On top of that, the visual concept is designed to make obtaining news more fun and exciting, and providing a brand new social media experience for the users.
  
## Team ##
Name | Role | Student Number
---- | ---- | --------------
Nhan Tri Nim | Programmer | 44215433
Yuzhan Zhang | Designer | 42871303
Soobin Son | Database Designer | 43152120
Dang Khoi Phan | Programmer | 43666887

### Breakdown of general roles and technical roles in the team ###

  1. Khoi
    - Team manager - making sure everyone is on track
    - Organising meetings and facilitate communications among team members
    - Facilitate communications between programmers and designers
    - Backup programmer and designer

  2. Nhan
    - Discussion regulator - making sure everyone is focused during meetings
    - Main programmer - make sure ideas are feasible for implementation
    - The 'critic' of the team: provides critical and insightful feedback for others' ideas

  3. Soobin
    - Database designer and social media manager
    - Manage the data - the content of the application
    - Manage social media, generate and conduct user testing and surveys

  4. Bella
    - The main designer of the team - in charge of generating creative design ideas as well as making sure the designs are consistent
    - In charge of producing a variety of designs, as well as testing those designs with potential users

### Team Charter ###
**Decision Making**
  - Brainstorming sessions are carried out whenever a new solution needs to be generated. During the brainstorming session, Khoi will be in charge of making sure no ideas are rejected, while at the end, Nhan will be in charge of making sure each idea is evaluated carefully
  - Whenever there are several ideas/solutions that are conflicting, the team will set up criteria and requirements in order to evaluate those solutions, in order to narrow them down and the evaluation is done again, iteratively until there is only one solution left.

**Team Responsibility**
  - At each stage of the project, each team member is responsible for an aspect of the application. By that, it means they need to make sure the goal for that aspect is reached by the agreed team deadline. However, other team members should also provide help willingly when possible, and the one in charge should also call out for help whenever necessary. 
  - When someone is behind in his or her part, they must make an effort to notify other team members about the issue, in order for others to help them out and make sure the project stays on track.
  - If there is conflict within the team, Khoi - the team manager - is responsible for making sure the conflict is resolved quickly and peacefully, and all the differences are resolved.

## Communication

### Team Communication
  - The main team meeting will be during the studio session on Friday. An extra meeting during the week will be scheduled whenever the team needs to discuss an urgent issue. Otherwise team members can communicate via the Facebook Group Chat.
  - The reason facebook is chosen instead of Slack is because team members will have a higher chance of checking their facebook chat than Slack, since it is not the official form of communication.
  - The main Slack channel will be checked frequently by the social media manager, and all new updates will be related back to all other team members

### Project Format
  - Github will be used to store all code as well as designs - measures have been taken to make sure all members know how to use SourceTree in order to make commits to the remote server, as well as create and manage separate branches for feature development
  - File names must not contain spaces - underscores should be used instead to separate words.
  - Designs should be in PNG24 format
