### Issue
  
  Nowadays people are constantly bombarded with a lot of news. 
  Consider the following scenario: You are surfing your favorite social network platform all jolly and such, behaving like how a standup citizen would, then someone decided to post something along the line of "Gummy bear contain real bear, *Gasps*". Being a long time supporter of the product, you went out of your way to verify the fact, meaning a lot of surfing the web with the promise of walls of text, not knowing if it just someone doing it for the fun and giggles...
  How many times have that already happen to you? 
  Are you tired of walls of text?
  I know that I am.
  
### Solution
  
  Well, how about a place where you can verify absolutely anything and everything that is regardeds as news by anyone?
  We not only help circulate the news and facts, but also give the user a wonderfull experience while they trying to obtain it.
  A social network, which is catered to feel like an space journey that contain lot of visualizations and effects. A universe, where you can go on a space experdition to seek the truth and having the power to create your own giant flying rocks whose entire existence and prosperity are depend on its ability to provide useful information to other fine space astronaunts such as yourself. 
  
  That is Factopia

### Audience
  Since the app focus on visualizing the distribution of information and news, naturally space enthusiasts and teenager and people who are exposed to the many existing social network an wanting a something with more than just blocks of text when they enquiry for information will be its main targeting audience. However, as the project grows, we plan to construct many different experiences that suitable for each individual so that everyone can enjoy and utilize all of the benefits that the application can offer.
  
#### Where's it difference from other technology existed
  It should be clear by now that the objective of our project is to transform the way people obtain news and fact by making it fun and exiting. It is a hybrid between a social network and a space exploring game to produce a brand new experience for people of all ages.

### Team Charter ###
**Decision Making**
  - Brainstorming sessions are carried out whenever a new solution needs to be generated. During the brainstorming session, Khoi will be in charge of making sure no ideas are rejected, while at the end, Nhan will be in charge of making sure each idea is evaluated carefully
  - Whenever there are several ideas/solutions that are conflicting, the team will set up criteria and requirements in order to evaluate those solutions, in order to narrow them down and the evaluation is done again, iteratively until there is only one solution left.

**Team Responsibility**
  - At each stage of the project, each team member is responsible for an aspect of the application. By that, it means they need to make sure the goal for that aspect is reached by the agreed team deadline. However, other team members should also provide help willingly when possible, and the one in charge should also call out for help whenever necessary. 
  - When someone is behind in his or her part, they must make an effort to notify other team members about the issue, in order for others to help them out and make sure the project stays on track.
  - If there is conflict within the team, Khoi - the team manager - is responsible for making sure the conflict is resolved quickly and peacefully, and all the differences are resolved.

## Communication

### Team Communication
  - The main team meeting will be during the studio session on Friday. An extra meeting during the week will be scheduled whenever the team needs to discuss an urgent issue. Otherwise team members can communicate via the Facebook Group Chat.
  - The reason facebook is chosen instead of Slack is because team members will have a higher chance of checking their facebook chat than Slack, since it is not the official form of communication.
  - The main Slack channel will be checked frequently by the social media manager, and all new updates will be related back to all other team members

### Project Format
  - Github will be used to store all code as well as designs - measures have been taken to make sure all members know how to use SourceTree in order to make commits to the remote server, as well as create and manage separate branches for feature development
  - File names must not contain spaces - underscores should be used instead to separate words.
  - Designs should be in PNG24 format
